          <span></span>A web developer designs and builds websites. They create pages, add content, and ensure the website looks great and works well. Web developers can specialize in front-end (what users see) or back-end (how it works behind the scenes). A full-stack developer does both! They handle both the front-end, like visuals and user experience, and the back-end, which involves server and database management. Full-stack developers have a wide range of skills, from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to databases and server-side languages. They make websites come alive, ensuring theyâ€™re fast, functional, and user-friendly. This versatile role is highly valued in tech, as it combines creativity with technical knowledge.
